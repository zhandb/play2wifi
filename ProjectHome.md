Open-source implementation of Apple's Airplay Protocol

## News ##
  * This project started as a Proof of Concept and should never be more. The feedback and the interesst of the community was however so big and overwhelming I decided to fix some bugs. However iOS 4.3 deeply changed the way Airplay is working and I didn't have the time to investigate this new Airplay further. There are now other implementations out which integrates really nice with XBMC. Therefore I will definitly put down this project. If you are still interessted in having Airplay support for XMBC have a look at [PascalW implementation](https://github.com/PascalW/Airplayer/).

Cheers

  * Thank everybody for your contributions and your patches. The new version is on the rails and will be released soon.
  * I don't know what about compatibility with the newly released iOS 4.3. Stay tuned for more details.
